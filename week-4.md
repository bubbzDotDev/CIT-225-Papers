## Final Project Design & Development

I've decided to use this project to help plan part of an actual full-stack web application I'm creating outside of school. It's a user-facing web dashboard for [Announcement Bot](https://www.announcementbot.live/), a [Discord](https://discord.com/) chat bot I created in the summer of 2020. It supports over 600 Discord servers. The app will use Discord's API to log users in via OAuth2 and let them perform various tasks with the bot to help them run their servers.

For the ERD, I am starting with the following tables and will think of at least two more to meet the minimum of 12:
1. `user`
1. `user_has_server` (linking table)
1. `server`
1. `channel`
1. `premium_level`
1. `template`
1. `announcement`
1. `recurring`
1. `embed`
1. `field`

I'm looking forward to working more on this project and increasing my understanding of database design and development.
