## Final Project Design & Development (cont.)

After finishing a seed.sql file last week, this week I broke out the different SQL queries for each table and saved them in their own files for easy organization.

In each file, I added a CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE section for ease of reference.

I also worked on some individual UI components. I have more work to do but glad to have made some progress.
