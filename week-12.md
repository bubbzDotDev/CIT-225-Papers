## Final Project Design & Development (cont.)

I finished some more mock-ups of user interface forms. The following is the user flow for adding the bot to a server.

When clicking on a card with the green plus icon, a modal appears to confirm adding the bot to a particular server:

Once the bot is added to the server, the user is brought to the dashboard welcome page:

After selecting the appropriate menu item for creating an embedded announcement, the user is brought to that page:
