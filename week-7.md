## Final Project Design & Development (cont.)

As I enter data into the database, I'm finding small errors. I'm going back to my ERD and correcting them and forward engineering again each time. It's a tedious, yet interesting process.

I just found out the `server_id` column's datatype of `INT` isn't large enough to support Discord's server ID numbers. So I'm researching `BIGINT()` to see how that works.

All in all, it's been a fun experience. I'm enjoying learning by doing even if it's a little at a time.
